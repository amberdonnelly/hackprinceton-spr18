it ’ easy 
mark wilson/getty images congress ’ give president donald trump money border wall — mexico certainly ’ paying — ’ asking administration go legally questionable lengths fund anyway 
trump spoken secretary defense james mattis using department defense money border wall pentagon spokesperson dana white confirmed thursday 
the president reportedly noted pentagon getting much money congress ’ 1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill could surely afford border wall according washington post 
to perfectly clear this government spending works 
congress passed massive spending package — trump signed — boosting military domestic funding march 23 
that spending bill allocated 1.6 billion border wall department homeland security specific instructions funds go toward repairing existing fencing toward double fencing barriers already exist 
in words trump ’ “ big beautiful ” wall get funding 
and pentagon received 700 billion part congress ’ government funding package putting funding military historic levels ’ blank check pentagon 
that money appropriated specific programs — spending border wall instead could illegal 
despite mattis seems humoring president ’ demands coming options fund border wall military 
most options likely carry legal concerns bear big political risks 
and still fail bring trump close 25 billion funding level wants wall 
government spending quickly explained donald trump a quick civics primer the legislative branch government manages nation ’ purse strings allocating money federal agencies authorizing funds used 
it ’ article i section 8 constitution congress power ” pay debts provide common defense general welfare united states. ” “ every line item subject tons legislative authorizing regulatory language strict limitations transfers re-programmings ” matthew dennis democratic spokesperson house appropriations committee said 
and using federal funds anything congress appropriates illegal antideficiency act enacted 1870 
in words trump ’ simply call department defense use excess money border wall 
even overseas contingency operations fund pentagon ’ emergency fund used “ future event circumstance possible predicted certainty ” often derided “ slush fund ” ’ blank check 
some amounts shifted like appropriations bill funding also regulated authorized congress 
it noted going congress government spending ’ impossible — extremely difficult carries risk legal political backlash 
so much exclusive report just security said trump ’ administration think using pentagon ’ money border wall good idea — including mattis 
nevertheless administration exploring idea 
if trump serious options 
they ’ questionable 
the department defense room move money around open trump ’ administration legal challenges political backlash ’ actually get trump much closer 25 billion ask fund wall 
one option reportedly consideration using counternarcotics funding sits 500 million just security ’ kate brannen writes in theory white house could make argument building border wall mexico purposes 
however pentagon ’ funding explicitly counternarcotics operating programs construction 
while ’ explicitly prohibited use funding construction ’ likely congress would furious spent way 
even though tapping fund would need congressional approval using part 500 million fund ’ get much mileage border 
for context congress appropriated 445 million 25 miles levee fencing rio grande valley 251 million replace 14 miles existing secondary fencing san diego sector 
the second option using emergency military construction milcon funding 
up 50 million used without congressional approval cases national security protect us military officers 
as brannen writes “ using milcon funding also guaranteed make members congress particularly angry would military construction projects districts would directly losing money wall. ” as william c. banks syracuse university law professor pointed new york times last year two laws give trump wiggle room move money around economy act 1932 could authorizes federal agencies exchange supplies services feed forage act 1799 law allowed military buy essential supplies like clothing medicine 
but according new york times “ accounting trick never used go around congress large scale mr. banks said. ” in options available department defense trump extremely limited scope 
and run risk going congress specifically project republicans ’ prioritized 
the spending bill largely ignored trump ’ immigration agenda mostly republicans entirely different one there ’ question congress ’ spending bill reflect hardline immigration agenda president trump white house long espoused 
as vox ’ dara lind writes trump get little asked “ congress actually making effort rein trump administration ’ overspending immigration detention instead expanding it. ” instead every spending fight since trump took office republicans repeatedly made clear wall restrictionist immigration policy ’ among spending priorities 
this time border wall get funding — 1.6 billion worth — much less 25 billion white house asked came lot strings attached funding go toward repairing existing fencing toward double fencing barriers already exist 
on enforcement republicans went spending fight wanting funding department homeland security increase number beds immigrant detainees expand enforcement force settled modest spending measures 
the final compromise included funding additional 328 customs border protection officers ice actually reduce number detention beds 
needless say ’ kind deportation force trump ’ administration envisioning 
the bill also defund so-called “ sanctuary cities ” something white house specifically called congress 
trump unhappy final spending package threatened veto bill altogether shut government walked ledge final hours 
now seems recognize congress ’ help get border wall going around legislative branch ’ easy 
his option seems gofundme campaign
