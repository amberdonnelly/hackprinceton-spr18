Mar 31, 2018 // 10:58am      As seen on Fox & Friends Weekend       by Fox News Insider     Posted in:   // Donald Trump  // Georgia  // Education  // Trending       GA Teacher Assigns Students to Write Letters to Lawmakers Pushing for Gun Control  Gorka: Trump Admin's Enhanced Vetting Leaves Behind Obama-Era 'Insanity'  On "Fox & Friends," Abby Huntsman interviewed a Georgia middle school student who captured audio of her teacher ripping President Donald Trump and his "Make America Great Again" slogan.  Josie Orihuela of Hampton Middle School near Atlanta began recording on her phone when sixth-grade teacher Johnetta Benton began reaming out the president.  "When my president says let's Make America Great Again, when was he talking about?" Benton is heard asking, and later adding that Trump must mean when "[America] was great for Europeans."  "Because," Benton continues, "when it comes to minorities, America has never been great for minorities."  Huntsman said the incident happened at the same high school where another teacher requested students write letters to their lawmakers demanding gun control.  This sixth grader recorded her teacher’s now viral anti-Trump rant. She says she’s disappointed her teacher would use her platform knowing she has an influence on students. pic.twitter.com/4cGj8dQFhe  — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 31, 2018  Orihuela said Benton made the comments as she was introducing a video to celebrate Black History Month.  "It kept getting worse and worse," she said.  Though not captured on the audio played by Huntsman, Orihuela said that at one point, Benton surmised aloud that "Make America Great Again" could be a precursor to "trying to bring back segregation."  In 1954, the Supreme Court - led by Chief Justice Earl Warren - outlawed school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.  Orihuela said she showed her mother the tape, and that they both were shocked by Benton's words.  Henry County School District spokesperson J.D. Hardin later called the incident "extremely unfortunate" and said that the "matter was addressed" after the tape went public.  Watch more above.
