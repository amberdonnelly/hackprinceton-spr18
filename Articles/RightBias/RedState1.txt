I’m sure this is going to work out well.
So, David Hogg the know-nothing know-it-all twit that is the figurehead of this AstroTurf anti-gun group organized around people who went to school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, FL., now has a new target.

I haven’t been a McCain fan since the days of the Keating Five scandal. In general, I feel that McCain is a pompous ass more interested in his own popularity and press clippings than anything else. I may have defended John McCain once back in 2008 when I was drunk. But it was an accident and I apologize. Having said that, seeing this zit-faced jerk insult a guy who has actually done something and paid his dues is just galling.



A child. as he terms himself, with even a modicum of upbringing and decency knows something about showing respect to a decorated war veteran who is roughly 60 years older and who is terminally ill. But not our boy Hogg. No siree. As far as he’s concerned the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
