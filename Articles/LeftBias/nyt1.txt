what happened 
image crime scene tape surrounded area mass shooting las vegas 
credit mark ralston/agence france-presse — getty images by robert j. spitzer oct. 3 2017 in immediate aftermath one worst mass shootings american history i sought information happened googling “ fully automatic weapons ” “ las vegas. ” audio recordings scene picked utterly distinctive sound fully automatic gunfire 
it appears gun modified semiautomatic weapon 
but instead turning details massacre top search results yielded multiple advertisements sites like “ battlefield vegas ” “ book now 
” m.g.v 
“ machine guns vegas ” customers purchase firing-range time fully automatic “ exclusive las vegas gun range packages ” according second website 
but happens vegas ’ always stay vegas sometimes line fantasy violence real thing disappears 
the horror mass shooting las vegas demarcated sheer number casualties inflicted single individual — 50 dead 500 injured — made possible use modified semi- automatic weapon weapons meaning fire continuous stream bullets depressing trigger 
semiautomatic weapons fire one bullet pull trigger 
the vegas shooting stands gun crimes committed annually america fully automatic modified semiautomatic weapons virtually never play role thanks america ’ first significant national gun law 
america ’ close-up experience automatic weapons nearly century ago culminated adoption national firearms act 1934 
prohibition later great depression fueled rise gangsterism spread unregulated powerful weapons developed warfare including tommy gun “ gun made twenties roar ” browning automatic rifle 
by start 1930s half states sharply regulated barred fully automatic weapons 
in summer 1934 president franklin d. roosevelt signed law measure bring gangster weapons equipment like sawed-off shotguns silencers federal control 
the new law required extensive intensive background check fingerprinting registration national database payment 200 fee 
the effectiveness measure amended slightly 1968 1986 ban possession full automatic weapons machine guns manufactured year put lid spread weapons 
according government records today half-million guns civilian hands 
to comply 1986 law expanding 1934 firearms act citizens barred purchasing fully automatic weapon made 1986 
that includes weapons manufactured fire full auto mode altered fire full auto 
of guns used crimes subject law enforcement tracing three every 1,000 machine guns 
this success story notwithstanding mass shootings rise facilitated weapons still deliver plenty destructive power 
in study mass shootings 30-year period third committed semiautomatic assault weapons perhaps five million weapons legally owned 2016 
yet even mass shootings rise nation gone opposite direction following contrary notion somehow would better fewer gun laws guns 
for example start 1980s 19 states banned concealed gun carrying civilians entirely 29 states great discretion whether grant carry permits 
only one state vermont imposed permitting restrictions 
as year nine states retain discretion whether grant permits new york one 
in 29 states permits must issued applicants unless felons mentally incompetent 12 states abolished permitting entirely 
in 24 states gun training required carry gun 
congress considering bill called concealed carry reciprocity require every state ’ concealed-carry standard accepted every state 
this would effect undercutting states stricter laws since would impose national lowest-common-denominator standard 
a different effort thwart successful gun law afoot congress the house representatives poised pass bill remove 1934 n.f.a 
background check registration fee requirements one must satisfy gun silencer also called “ suppressors ” 
because las vegas shooting bill shelved things die expect progress resume 
the reason change 
advocates argue silencers almost never used crimes silencers help protect gun users ’ hearing 
yet reason silencers originally subject registration regulations used crimes chief utility conceal gun crimes illegal hunting guns 
and modern idea protecting shooter ’ hearing laudable effective method would subsidize gun owners ’ ownership proper hearing-protection devices precisely innocent bystanders tell hostile fire coming — whether woods hunting season killing grounds downtown las vegas 
the gun issue virtually one default response increasingly shrug say laws ’ matter since bad people bad things bother new ones 
that facile false logic jumps obvious question shouldn ’ government keep highly destructive weapons wrong hands 
sure ’ politically fraught question ’ less important 
admittedly mass shooters tend individuals little serious criminal past making hard identify commit acts 
recent research suggested high correlation abuse intimate partners family members vast majority abusers never pick gun shoot bunch people 
still many mass shooters give indications impending violence around states measures place pick 
new york happens one extensive character background investigation pistol permit applicants process i underwent 
other states would well follow lead 
if ’ settle sensible gun regulations wake sandy hook san bernardino orlando las vegas aurora columbine virginia tech 
maybe answer emerge nation ’ cumulative gun violence toxicity level reaches critical tipping point
